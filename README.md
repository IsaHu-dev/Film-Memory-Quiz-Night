- __UX DESIGN__

  - I have provided principles of good UX design. It provides a clean, intuitive interface with clear navigation and visual feedback. The layout is simple and user-friendly, ensuring that users can easily follow the flow of the quiz, from answering questions to viewing their results. The color scheme creates good contrast for readability, and interactive elements like buttons are visually distinct, making it easy for users to interact with the application. Additionally, the quiz is responsive, adapting well to both mobile and desktop devices, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.

  - The Colour Palette - consists of a combination of neutral, vibrant, and contrasting colors, supports good UX design in several ways. Dark tones like "Extra Black" (222222) and "Extra Black" (181A20) offer excellent readability when paired with lighter text, enhancing clarity and reducing eye strain, especially in low-light environments. The use of "Keypad" (5DBEA3) brings a calming, balanced tone to the interface, often associated with trust and ease of use, ideal for interactive elements like buttons. Bright accent colors such as "Deep Pink" (EC3992) and "Dragonfruit" (D9006E) draw attention to critical actions or alerts, improving user engagement. Together, this palette supports user-friendly interactions by balancing readability, visual emphasis, and emotional appeal, creating a seamless and intuitive experience.
