- __UX DESIGN__

  I have provided principles of good UX design. It provides a clean, intuitive interface with clear navigation and visual feedback. The layout is simple and user-friendly, ensuring that users can easily follow the flow of the quiz, from answering questions to viewing their results. The interactive elements (i.e., the buttons) are visually distinct, making it easy for users to interact with the application. 

  - The Colour Palette - consisting of a combination of neutral, vibrant, and contrasting colours - supports good UX design in several ways. Dark tones like "Extra Black" (222222) and "Extra Black" (181A20) and Charcoal (333) keeps the palette balanced, when placed next to the pink shades. It offers excellent readability when paired with lighter text and enhance clarity.
  
  - Bright accent colors such as "Deep Pink" (DF0B75) and "Dragonfruit" (EB59A2) draw attention to critical actions or alerts, improving user engagement. Together, this palette supports user-friendly interactions by balancing readability, visual emphasis, and emotional appeal, creating a seamless and intuitive experience.

  - Additionally, the high contrast between buttons and their backgrounds ensures that they are accessible to a wide range of users, including those with visual impairments, by adhering to accessibility guidelines.
